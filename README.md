# Magpie 4

Follow the instructions for Activity 4 provided in the student lab guide. You have one week to complete this lab. Once you have completed the lab, be sure to commit and push your code in Atom.

The "I, you" structure doesn't work well with a negative statement - i.e. "I don't like you" (returns "Why do you don't like me?") This can be solved by adding another check for "I don't - you" and/or "I do not - you".
